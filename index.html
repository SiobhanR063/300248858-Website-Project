        <h1>So, the University of Ottawa huh?</h1>
        <p>The University of Ottawa, located in the Capital City of Canada. A popular school for health sciences, engineering, law- a well regarded STEM school. So why take Journalism here? I know, I know, I hear you thinking about how <abbr title="University of Ottawa"> UO </abbr> is Carleton's sidekick. Based on the Panda Game, it should be the other way around.  But UO is full of lots of fun experiences, wonderful people, and above all it has a beautiful campus which instills its students with motivation and fantastic work ethic.  </p>
        <p>The professors are all well versed in various aspects of the media industry. From Pultizer Prize winners, to producers at CBC, to people who have worked on political campaigns, the University of Ottawa Digital Journalism program offers lots to students. It even offers an internship! Additionally, being a joint program with the famous Algonquin College, students are getting twice the bang for their buck by attending UO.</p>

        <h2>Location!!!!</h2>
        <p>There are many things to like about Ottawa. The Canadiana, the river, the beautiful galleries and museums the public can use for personal enrichment. But one of the main appeals of the University of Ottawa (in my humble opinion) is just how beautifiul our campus is.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows that TMU (formerly known as Ryerson, whose name was changed for an important reason) is a good journalism school. Featured in downtown Toronto, it is regarded as "the place to be for journalism". That's great and all (and very biased, since Torontonians think the world revolves around them). But one thing that Ryerson doesn't have? A beautiful campus. Namely, one that looks like this:</p>

        <p>Our school has so many buildings, which makes every student feel at home. Everyone has their hub!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simard for most of the Faculty of Arts students</li>
        <li> Desmerais for Communications, History, and Telfer</li>
        <li> STEM for Engineering (lucky them, they also have some of SITE)</li>
        <li> And many, many more!</li>
        <p> I can only spoonfeed you so much information you know. I'm not getting paid to advertise.</p>
      </ul>
        <h2>School Culture!</h2>
        <p>Something that's very important to note about UO is the fact that we are the largest bilingual university in Canada! Francophone and Anglophone students alike are able to find classes, clubs, and friends that accomodate their needs. There's even opportunities to become bilingual within your university courses. Pass/fail marks? What's there not to like?</p>
        <p>I seem pretty diehard about my university, I know. But I can admit not everything is good. Like our mascot. Most first years come into this school thinking "what the heck is a geegee?" Well my friend, I have a simple answer for you. According to our University:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://thefulcrum.ca/sports/a-gee-gee-is/"> "The Gee-Gee, which is the first horse out of the gate in a race, was adopted as the University of Ottawa brand initially to appeal to both the anglophone and francophone student populations. Since the initials “GG” can be used to describe the school colours, garnet and grey, in both languages, the nickname stuck." </blockquote>
        <p>Well, we're stuck with it. But at least you can admit such a weird mascot gives our university sort of a quirky charm. Am I right or am I right?</p>
